Where:
M = Modifier (which varies by the type of assignment and/or by user preference)
C = Credits (of the course)
P = Points (rounded to nearest integer)
D = Days until due date

Rank = (MP)/D * C

The following possible adjustments are then considered:

-If Rank is negative, then it is underflowed to be a large positive number, such that the final rank = 9,007,199,254,740,992 (IEEE 754 DBL_MAX) + Rank.
This makes it so that overdue assignments are always considered to be more important than anything else, and are still ranked fairly amongst themselves.

-If D >= 30, the final rank is reduced by 3 (so as to avoid over-prioritizing assignments that are not yet relevant.)
-If D >= 14 and D < 30, the final rank is reduced by 1 for the same reason as above.

Ties will be handled automatically by due date as a result of earlier assignments being listed earlier in the file than later assignments.
